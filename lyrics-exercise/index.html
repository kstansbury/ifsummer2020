<div class="brackets">[Verse 1]</div>
<div>Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota</div>
<div>There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon</div>
<div>And one day his woman ran off with another guy</div>
<div>Hit young Rocky in the eye</div>
<div>Rocky didn't like that</div>
<div>He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"</div>
<div>So one day he walked into town</div>
<div>Booked himself a room in the local saloon</div>

<wbr>

<div class="brackets">[Hook]</div>
<div>Rocky Raccoon checked into his room</div>
<div>Only to find Gideon's Bible</div>
<div>Rocky had come, equipped with a gun</div>
<div>To shoot off the legs of his rival</div>

<wbr>

<div class="brackets">[Verse 2]</div> 
<div>His rival it seems, had broken his dreams</div>
<div>By stealing the girl of his fancy</div>
<div>Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil</div>
<div>But everyone knew her as Nancy</div>
<div>Now she and her man, who called himself Dan</div>
<div>Were in the next room at the hoe down</div>
<div>Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin</div>
<div>He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"</div>
<div>But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot</div>
<div>And Rocky collapsed in the corner</div>

<div class="brackets">[Verse 3]</div>
<div>Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin</div>
<div>And proceeded to lie on the table</div>
<div>He said, "Rocky, you met your match"</div>
<div>And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch</div>
<div>And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"</div>

<wbr>

<div class="brackets">[Hook]</div>
<div>Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room</div>
<div>Only to find Gideon's Bible</div>
<div>Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt</div>
<div>To help with good Rocky's revival</div>

<wbr>

<div class="brackets">[Outro]</div>
<div>C'mon, Rocky boy</div>
<div>C'mon, Rocky boy</div>
