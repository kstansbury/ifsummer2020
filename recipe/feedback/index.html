    <h3>My Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The relationship between the introductory paragraph and the photo does not look totally considered yet, especially right when it switches to the vertical display.</li>
            <li>The recipe title at the top of the page needs more consideration in terms of sizing and formatting at smaller browser widths.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Peer Feedback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Right side of image extends too far</li>
            <li>Try moving image up in line with yield and time</li>
            <li>Adjust Title to one line at smallest scale</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
