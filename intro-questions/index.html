        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Kaitlyn Stansbury and I'm a rising junior pursuing a BFA in Communication Design and a minor in writing.</p>
        <p>2. This is a required course for my major but I would take this course regardless because I think knowing how to code is a huge asset in the design field.  </p>
        <p>3. I have no experience at all. </p>
        <p>4. I would like to learn how to make and publish functioning websites.</p>
        <p>5. I expect that designing for the screen will be different from designing for paper in terms of anticipating how the user will interact with the final product. On paper, the user consumes the content at set dimensions and following a chronology predetermined by the designer. On screen, the user experience has more variability. With websites, for example, the user’s experience varies from the small screen of a phone to the larger screen of a laptop. The user also has more agency in terms of how they navigate the content. For example, when reading an article online, the user could click on a hyperlink embedded in an article and have a completely different reading experience than if they were just reading on paper.</p>
        <p>6. http://dazzle.studio/</p>
        <p> I think this website exemplifies effective design because it is fun to interact with, effectively reflecting the personality of the design agency and demonstrating the type of work they can do. </p>
        <p>7. https://www.newyorker.com/</p>
        <p>I think The New Yorker's website is a good example of effective communication because there is a clear hierarchy of information achieved through shifts in scale, font, color, etc. </p>
        <p>8. https://undraw.co/illustrations </p>
        <p>This website works really well because it has good search functions and you can easily download open-source illustrations.</p>
